Things I have to model:
1. Unicast
2. Multicast with election
3. The distribution of the keys

Things I have to explain in the paper
Unicast:
1. How IKEv2 works
2. How IKEv2 modeled
3. What is the difference of my work between IKEv2
// It is very similar, the exchanges are the same but payloads are different
// My unicast case is not only suitable for IPSec but also can be used in TCP-AO

Multicast:
1. How GDOI and G-IKEv2 works
2. Maybe how GDOI modeled
3. What is the relationship between "Election Procedure" and "GDOI/G-IKEv2"
// Can reference G-SAM which is also a group key management protocol
// Can reference Dr. Li's Paper:
   > Distribution of the keys
   > The election part is different, it has a kind of build-in election to elect a Q, and notice all the customers.
   // it's like the kids notice their parents die, but my election is like brothers notice their strongest brother die and choose another strongest one.

Keep in mind:
The thesis is like teach the examers a lesson. You can't assume they know everything but teach them everything they need to know.
